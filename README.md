# Page-Rank-Algorithm
The PageRank algorithm is an algorithm used in web mining that measures the importance or relevance of web pages. It was developed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the co-founders of Google, as a key component of their search engine's ranking algorithm. The main idea behind the PageRank algorithm is that the importance of a web page is determined by the number and quality of the links pointing to that page. In other words, a page is considered more important if it is linked to by other important pages.<br/>
The PageRank score is iteratively calculated based on the following principles:
<li><ol>
Damping Factor: A damping factor (typically set to 0.85) is introduced to model the probability that a user stops following links and randomly jumps to another page. It ensures that the algorithm does not get stuck in an infinite loop by continuously following links.</ol>

Link Analysis: Each page distributes a fraction of its PageRank score equally among the pages it links to. The more outbound links a page has, the smaller the fraction of its score each link receives. This reflects the idea that a page's importance is diluted when it links to many other pages.</ol>
<ol>
Incoming Links: The PageRank score of a page is influenced by the PageRank scores of the pages linking to it. A page with many high-quality incoming links will have a higher PageRank score compared to a page with fewer or lower-quality incoming links.</ol>
